output= 65535
reson: range of int is -2147483648 to 2147483647, range of byte is -128 to 127. -1 is included in both, hence conversion from int to byte doesn't result
in any change of value. The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff'
(or 65,535 inclusive). Hence, on conversion of char to int, the char changes to the largest value it could hold, 65535.
